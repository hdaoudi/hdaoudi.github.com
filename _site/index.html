	This study shows a discussion of the theory of advertising in relation with the theory of network effects or 
	externalities. This paper finds that these theories combine into a solid theoretical framework for research on 
	advertising on social network sites and as a basis for empirical research. A good exhibits network 
	externalities if its value depends on the number of adopters. I show that participants of a communication 
	network value the exchange of information more as more people receive that information. Advertisers and 
	their advertisements in social network sites behave in a similar fashion as the exchanged information to 
	produce sales becomes more valuable to them as more people acquire it. In second degree price 
	discrimination, social network sites are able to create producer surplus by adapting their service according 
	to access to the network for advertisers. First, I present social network sites within an adapted version of 
	the traditional network externality models. Second, I explore how this model can be used to study 
	advertising on social network sites. Third, I present social network site Twitter and a few empirical findings 
	from the activities of Fortune 100 companies on this communication network.
